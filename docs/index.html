                I am also secondarily interested in several questions in Philosophy. My main work in this area is a "Bayesian resolution" to Hume's problem of Induction, that I hope to publish at some point. Working on it has been a saga. 
                <!-- The main thurst of the work can be infomrally prhased as "So long as your beliefs are consitent, given sufficient time you will slay all deamons". Meaning that time and observation will allow you to—in some sense—not only defeat the sceptism of Hume but also that of a maximalist reading of Descartes and of the Cynics more broadly. However, as a non-professional philosopher, I'm not sure how seriously to ultimately take the argument. -->

            <h2 class="section-title">I am</h2>
            <p>
              I am made of stories. Told to myself, by myself, about myself. A paradox perhaps, but also undoubtably the truth. I wear them like armor in a universe that I can only build out of stories but which is ultimately made out of details. Stories are the death of detail and details the death of stories. Let me be a story of infinite omission, rather than a lie with an intent to deceive. Let my armor be made of reality, though it be pruned to near non existence.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a cartoon character drawn with lines to separate me from infinity. I am also the cartoon world I navigate. The only lines separating the pen I write with from the air it moves through exist in me, and us, for now. I paint mountains and my mountains are me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a fuzzy collection of quantum amplitudes representing a trillion micro-organisms working together for their greater good in a world, the true world, without color, without smells, without stories. Only details, only infinite truth, austere but filled with overwhelming, fractal multiplicity.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am not alone. I am made of stories, told by us, about everything. I am made of mathematics, star stuff, and recipes for cake discovered or invented by you, by us, by we. I am not alone, and neither are you.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am made of hugs, from my parents, friends, family. I am made of my wife's fingers, playing with my hair. I am made of the simple syrup and orange juice which were all I could keep down in the illness that left me floor ridden, crawling across Yosemite cabin carpet.
            </p>
            <p>
              I get to choose. Which circle will I draw through infinity and label as me? Which parts of you will I include? My cartoon painting of your face? Your voice, your stories, your laughter, your pain?
            </p>
            <p>
              My choice will not be final. I am a breathing, flexing circle, drawn again and yet again. The pen, which is the air and the page till lines are drawn, cuts its circuit every day, every day taking a different path. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As we sit here and paint these mountains together. I hope your mountains, the you that is the mountains, the story of mountains told to yourself, by yourself, about yourself, is at least as beautiful as mine.

                  My name is Matthew Gray. I was born in Berkeley California, did my undergrad at UC Santa Cruz, worked for Microsoft Norway in Oslo, worked for Renton Technical College outside of Seattle, and am now persuing a DPhil in Computer Science at the University of Oxford. 
                  I am grateful to be affiliated with Magdalen College and advised by Rahul Santhanam.

                  My primary research lies at the intersection of quantum computing, cryptography, and meta-complexity. I have proved meta-complexity characterizations for OWPuzz, EFI, and Quantum Sampling Advantage.

                  I have pretty wide secondary interests. Both in the wider world of TCS and in the social sciences. I have deep interests in Philosophy, History, Economics, and Political Science. Here's a breif (and very non exuastive) sampling of my interests in these areas: 
                  Monetary theory and the macro-economics of state finance, Sortition (aka the democratic lottery), the successes and failures of computational meta-physics, the philosophy of simulation (Bostrom messed up in at least 2 important ways), formal theories of politics and coercive negotiations, the practiciality of a nuclear first strike and American nuclear hegemony in the 1940s, Historical cryptography and conspiracy.

                  More personally, I really like to cook, play board games, read, listen to podcasts, and exist near trees and bodies of water.

                  Feel free to reach out if you are interested in Quantum Meta-Complexity or Quantum Cryptography. I'd be excited to talk.
